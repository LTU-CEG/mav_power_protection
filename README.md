# Over/Under voltage protection with inrush current limitation

A simple module to protect system from over/under voltage and inrush current
scenarios which can damage the downstream system.

Currently the design parameters are:

* Over voltage level: 18V
* Under voltage level: 5V
* Inrush current limitation: 500 mA
